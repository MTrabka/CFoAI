# Inverted Turing Test Project

An **Inverted Turing Test** application where a judge (powered by AI) interacts with either another AI participant or a human participant to determine whether the participant is human or artificial. The project explores conversational dynamics and evaluates how well participants can simulate human-like responses.

## Features

- **Two Interaction Modes**:
  - **AI vs. AI**: The AI judge converses with another AI participant to simulate a fully automated Turing test.
  - **AI vs. Human**: The AI judge interacts with a human participant, who attempts to convince the AI of their humanity. (Yet to be done)
- **Dynamic Conversation**: Each interaction involves multiple rounds of question-and-answer, with the judge making a final decision at the end.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the application.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the user interface and managing routes.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: AI-powered judge and content generator.
- **dotenv**: For securely loading environment variables like the API key.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for the web interface.
